## [R for Psychological Science by Danielle Navarro ](https://psyr.djnavarro.net/)
**What is this?**
Excerpt from Site by Navarro: 
"I‚Äôve set this up as an introductory resource for psychology students taking my Programming with R class at UNSW. There are two goals with this resource. The first is to provide an introduction to R programming that doesn‚Äôt assume any previous experience. The second is to provide a brief sketch of some of things that R can be useful for in psychology. Data analysis inevitably forms a large part of this, but I hope to cover a broader range of topics".

Warning: these materials absolutely do not constitute a self-contained ‚Äúbook‚Äù, nor do they capture all workshop content.

## [Modelling and visualizing data using R: A practical introduction by Daniel Nettle](https://www.danielnettle.org.uk/r-modelling/)
**What is this?**
Excerpt from site:
This is a basic overview of using R for data analysis, and of linear statistical modelling. It would be suitable for anyone who has had some stats training but not used R; or has used R a little but not become confident; or has neither had stats training nor used R but is not happy with a reasonably steep learning curve. The emphasis is on rapidly getting to be able to use R for most of the common practical purposes, and knowing that you can take it further should you need to. It is designed for you to be able to work through on your own.

## [Programming with R by The Carpentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)
**What is this?**
Excerpt from site:
This lesson is written as an introduction to R, but its real purpose is to introduce the single most important idea in programming: how to solve problems by building functions, each of which can fit in a programmer‚Äôs working memory. In order to teach that, we must teach people a little about the mechanics of manipulating data with lists and file I/O so that their functions can do things they actually care about. Our teaching order tries to show practical uses of every idea as soon as it is introduced; instructors should resist the temptation to explain the ‚Äúother 90%‚Äù of the language as well.

## [Fundamentals of R Workshop Materials_Contributors: Elizabeth Page-Gould & Alexander Danvers](https://osf.io/a2x7j/) üå± 
**What is this?**
Excerpt from site: Have you been meaning to start using R for analysis? Have you been wondering how R can make your analysis easier and your research reproducible? We present a practical introduction to R, demonstrating core analyses in psychology research (e.g., ANOVA, regression). We also explain how to manipulate and clean data in R to maintain a precise record of how the data went from raw to analysis-ready. The ideal audience for this workshop is a researcher who has not used R before, has used it briefly and then gone back to SPSS for the final analyses, or who has used R a few times but wants a better grounding in the basics.

## [A gentle crash course in R using tidyverse _Contributors: Nicholas M. Michalak &  Loek Brinkman](https://osf.io/69gub/) üå± 
**What is this?**
Description from site: In this three-hour workshop, we introduce you to data science in the R programming language. In particular, we'll show you how to use the "tidyverse" package to transform, visualize and model data. The workshop consists of short introductory presentations followed by elaborate hands-on sessions. At the end of each section, we'll showcase more complex features and functionality. The workshop is designed as an introduction to R. Zero programming experience is required. By the end of the workshop, you'll have a "feel" for what R is and what it can do for you, and we'll provide resources for follow-up self-study.

The course focuses on doing data science, not writing code; but by the end of the day students will find that they have gained confidence writing code with R.

**Data Wrangling with the Tidyverse** An introduction to wrangling lists and tabular data in R with the tidyr, stringr, forcats, lubridate, and purrr packages. The course focuses on creating and using tidy tables and is designed to be a sequel to Welcome to the Tidyverse.

## [Just Enough R](https://benwhalley.github.io/just-enough-r/) üå±
**What is this?**
Excerpt from e-book here:R makes it easy to work with and learn from data.

It also happens to be a programmming language, but if you‚Äôre reading this, that might not be of interest. That‚Äôs OK ‚Äî the goal here is not to teach programming1. The goal is to teach you just enough R to be confident to explore your data.

This book uses R like any other statistics software: To work-with and visualise data, run statistical analyses, and share our results with others. To do that you don‚Äôt need more than the absolute basics of the R language itself.
